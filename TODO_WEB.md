- Correct cost extraction, if not possible then clean in up
- Have a dataset for domains and their categories rather than reading directly as a dictionary in checkout-widget.js
- Have a dataset for cards and their benefits
    - A scraping script for online card info websites to create the dataset, need to solve the problem of regularity (how often are we scraping to reflect the latest changes)
    - Look for any exisiting ones
    - Credit card benefits
        - Need to request user for their expiration date only to determine benefits expiration
        - Seasonal benefits
        - Solving the problem of how to log amount to determine the benefits amount limit which might reset after a period time
            - Could me static (a slider bar or manually entering amount) like existing tools
- Data analysis of user transactions
    - Allowing user to confirm whether they made the purchase with our recommendation
    - Gamifying the experience
    - Showing things like streaks
    - Educational content
    - Showing some quick bite stats like: "Hey! you saved upto 100 dollars with our extension!!!"
- User onboarding!!!!
    - Downloading one time nano
    - Setting all the flags
    - Can this be automated to be as friction less as possible, just installing the extension should be able to do all of this
